# Garmin adapter for Light & Motion Urban
Handlebars are designed for hands, but mine have become cluttered with things like lights and computers.  This adapter allows a Garmin out-front style computer mount to hold a Light & Motion Urban headlight, thus removing it from the handlebars.

It's just a prototype for now, to explore what else is needed for a complete design.
